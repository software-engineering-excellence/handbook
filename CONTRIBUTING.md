# Contribution Guidelines

> Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

We welcome any contributions - if you have any ideas for new chapters that we should cover in the handbook or other suggestions, please raise a ticket first.

## Please note

Content in this repository may be published as a physical book. Please be aware that any contributions may be used commercially. We will try to keep track of contributors and attribute them in any printed material, but cannot make any guarantees on this, and therefore please note that any contributions waive all rights to copyright.

## Use of images

Please make sure to attribute images properly if you are referencing them. Also, include a white background, as some viewers will be viewing the site in 'Dark Mode' which can make images with a transparent background difficult to read.
