## What is the Software Engineering Excellence Handbook?

The Software Engineering Excellence Handbook is a comprehensive guide that outlines best practices, principles, and techniques for developing high-quality software. It covers various aspects of software development, including requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The handbook provides guidance on how to build software that is secure, reliable, scalable, maintainable, and efficient.

## What is it not?

The Software Engineering Excellence Handbook is not a specific tool or framework. It does not provide step-by-step instructions on how to develop a particular software application. Instead, it offers general principles and guidelines that can be applied to any software development project. The handbook is also not a substitute for experience, expertise, or good judgment. It is intended to be a reference guide that can help software developers make informed decisions and improve their skills over time.
