## 1. Definition and Benefits

Code review is a process of examining the source code of a software application to identify and fix errors, improve code
quality, and ensure compliance with coding standards. Code reviews are an essential part of the software development
process as they help to catch bugs and improve the overall quality of the codebase.

The benefits of code reviews include:

- Improved code quality: Code reviews help to identify and fix errors, improve code readability, and ensure compliance
  with coding standards, resulting in higher quality code.
- Better collaboration: Code reviews encourage collaboration between team members, leading to better communication and
  knowledge sharing.
- Reduced bugs and technical debt: Code reviews help to catch bugs early in the development process, reducing the
  likelihood of bugs making it to production and reducing technical debt.
- Improved security: Code reviews can help to identify security vulnerabilities in the codebase, reducing the risk of
  security breaches.

## 2. Preparing Code Reviews

Before starting a code review, it's important to prepare the codebase and the team. Here are some steps to follow:

- Establish coding standards: Establish coding standards that all team members should follow. This will help to ensure
  consistency and make code reviews more efficient.
- Set up a code review process: Establish a code review process that all team members should follow. This should include
  guidelines for submitting code for review, assigning reviewers, and providing feedback.
- Choose a code review tool: Choose a code review tool that suits your team's needs. There are many tools available,
  including GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
- Train team members: Train team members on the code review process and the chosen code review tool. This will help to
  ensure that everyone is on the same page and can participate effectively in code reviews.

## 3. Performing Code Reviews

Performing a code review involves examining the code for errors, readability, and compliance with coding standards. Here
are some steps to follow:

- Review the code: Review the code carefully, looking for errors, readability issues, and compliance with coding
  standards.
